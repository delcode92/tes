I have parking payment case. in first  2 hours it will pay 2000 as based price, then in next 4 hours it will added 1000 from based price, then in next 6 hours it will add 1000 from based price, then if has been 24 hours it will be 6000 as flat value
show me simple algorithm that can handle that concept, so I don't need hard coded if someday that conditions above will be added or some condition will be removed 

your answer above almost correct, I will give you sample case bellow, so you can improved your answer
1) < 10 minutes --> 0
2) 11 minutes -->  2000
3)  3 hours --> still  2000
4)  4 hours  --> has been  3000
5)  5 hours --> still 3000
6)  6 hours --> has been  4000
7) 8 hours --> still  4000
8) 24 hours --> has been  6000
9) 1 day + 5 hours --> still  6000
10) 2 days --> has been 12000


x = ...    
y = ...
z = ...

I have three varibles above, 
case:
- if one variable has a value, another two variables must not empty, 
- if two varibles has value, the other one must not be empty

how I can create simple solution/algorithm for that ?

def sub(self):

def main(self):

I have JS code below:

# start code 
if (h2>h1){
    if(h3>h2){
        // execute some code
    }
    else{
        // show alert here
        return false;
    }
}
else{
    // show alert here
    return false;
}
# end code

please make more simple code than above

explain python code below:
btn.clicked.connect(lambda *args, row=rows: self.editData(row, table, "laporan"))
